# Data cleaning with Pandas

Here we are going to clean a data set related to absenteeism. Now we are defining absenteeism in a following way.

It's the absence from work during normal working hours, resulting in temporary incapacity to execute a regular working activity.

We want to help the business people figure out how to preserve high productivity rates.

We will only make sure that the raw data set has been turned into meaningful quantitative information.

Our aim is to free our raw dataset from:
Mistakes, Missing Values, Incomprehensible organization(i.e. Bad data).

The raw data set is Absenteeism-data.csv and df-cleaned.csv is the cleaned data set.
